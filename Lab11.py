"""
Program to count the number of English words that begin
with each letter of the alphabet and display that
information to the screen in a nicely formatted manner.

# I included english.py here in the repository, but you'll need to import it



# Then include your function or code to count and output the desired information
# to the screen here below. You are just outputting information to the screen
# today, no need to have any function you write return anything
